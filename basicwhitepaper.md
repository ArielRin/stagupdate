## **5. Key Features**

StagTokenV2 is equipped with a suite of features designed to enhance user experience, ensure security, and promote sustainable growth. Below is an in-depth exploration of each feature:

### **5.1. BEP20 Compliance**

StagTokenV2 adheres to the BEP20 standard, ensuring compatibility with the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. This compliance facilitates seamless integration with wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi platforms within the BSC network.

### **5.2. Reflection Mechanism**

The reflection mechanism rewards token holders passively by redistributing a portion of transaction fees back to all existing holders. This incentivizes holding over selling, fostering long-term community engagement.

**How It Works:**

- **Dual Supply Mapping:** Utilizes `_rOwned` (reflection-owned) and `_tOwned` (token-owned) mappings to manage reflections.
- **Automatic Redistribution:** A percentage of each transaction fee (RFI) is deducted and proportionally distributed among all token holders.
- **Benefits:**
  - Encourages holding, reducing sell pressure.
  - Provides continuous passive income to holders.
  - Enhances token scarcity over time.

### **5.3. Fee Structure**

StagTokenV2 implements a multi-tiered fee structure to support various operational and developmental aspects of the project.

#### **Fee Categories:**

1. **Reflection Fee (RFI):**
   - **Purpose:** Redistributes tokens to holders, promoting passive income.
   - **Rate:** 3% on buys and sells.

2. **NFT Reward:**
   - **Purpose:** Allocates funds for NFT-related rewards, fostering community engagement through collectibles or utilities.
   - **Rate:** 2% on buys and sells.

3. **Operations (Ops):**
   - **Purpose:** Supports operational costs and marketing initiatives.
   - **Rate:** 0% on buys and sells.

4. **Liquidity:**
   - **Purpose:** Maintains liquidity pools to ensure market stability and ease of trading.
   - **Rate:** 1% on buys, 2% on sells.

5. **Development (Dev):**
   - **Purpose:** Funds ongoing development, security audits, and strategic partnerships.
   - **Rate:** 2% on buys, 44% on sells.

#### **Launch Tax:**

- **Purpose:** Allocates a significant portion (99%) to the development wallet during the initial launch phase, supporting rapid development and marketing efforts.
- **Rate:** 99% during launch.

*Note: The fee structure is configurable by the contract owner, allowing adjustments to adapt to evolving project needs.*

### **5.4. Automated Liquidity Management**

StagTokenV2 ensures consistent liquidity through the `swapAndLiquify` function, which automates the process of adding liquidity to the liquidity pool.

**Mechanism:**

1. **Token Accumulation:** A portion of transaction fees is accumulated within the contract.
2. **Swapping Tokens for BNB:**
   - **Process:** Tokens earmarked for liquidity are swapped for BNB using the PancakeSwap router.
   - **Rate:** Determined by the current fee structure (1% on buys, 2% on sells for liquidity).
3. **Adding Liquidity:**
   - **Process:** The swapped BNB and corresponding tokens are added to the liquidity pool, enhancing market depth and stability.
   - **Benefits:**
     - Reduces price volatility.
     - Ensures sufficient liquidity for trading.
     - Facilitates smoother buy and sell operations.

**Security Measures:**

- **Reentrancy Guards:** Prevents reentrant calls during the swap and liquify process.
- **Thresholds:** Executes liquidity additions only when the contract balance exceeds a predefined threshold (`swapTokensAtAmount`).

### **5.5. Maximum Wallet Limit**

To promote equitable token distribution and prevent market manipulation by large holders, StagTokenV2 implements a **Maximum Wallet Limit**.

**Features:**

- **Maximum Limit:** Initially set to 1% of the total supply (`maxWalletAmount = _tTotal / 100`).
- **Exemptions:** Certain addresses, including the owner, contract itself, and designated wallets (`nftRewardWallet`, `opsWallet`, `devWallet`, `deadWallet`), are exempted from this limit.
- **Configurability:** The owner can adjust the maximum wallet limit and manage exemptions as needed.

**Purpose:**

- **Prevents Whale Accumulation:** Mitigates the risk of a single wallet holding a disproportionate amount of tokens, reducing market manipulation risks.
- **Encourages Broad Distribution:** Fosters a more decentralized and community-driven token ownership structure.
- **Enhances Market Stability:** Limits the impact of large trades by significant holders, promoting more stable price movements.

**Implementation:**

The maximum wallet limit is enforced within the `_transfer` function, ensuring that recipients do not exceed the set limit post-transaction unless they are exempted.

### **5.6. Ownership and Governance**

StagTokenV2 adopts the **Ownable** pattern to manage administrative functions securely. The contract owner wields significant control to ensure the project's strategic direction and operational integrity.

**Ownership Features:**

- **Access Control:** Critical functions (e.g., fee adjustments, liquidity management) are restricted to the contract owner.
- **Transfer of Ownership:** The owner can transfer or renounce ownership, providing flexibility in governance.
- **Exclusion Management:** The owner can exclude/include addresses from fees, rewards, and the maximum wallet limit.

**Future Governance Enhancements:**

While the current implementation centralizes ownership, future iterations may incorporate decentralized governance models (e.g., multi-signature wallets, community voting) to distribute control and enhance security.

### **5.7. Security Measures**

Ensuring the security of the smart contract and its assets is paramount. StagTokenV2 integrates multiple layers of security to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

**Key Security Features:**

1. **Reentrancy Guards:**
   - **Implementation:** The `lockTheSwap` modifier prevents reentrant calls during sensitive operations like token swaps and liquidity additions.
   - **Benefit:** Mitigates reentrancy attacks that could exploit contract vulnerabilities.

2. **Access Restrictions:**
   - **Ownable Pattern:** Critical functions are restricted to the contract owner, preventing unauthorized modifications.
   - **Exclusion Controls:** Only the owner can manage fee and reward exclusions, ensuring controlled access.

3. **Input Validations:**
   - **Require Statements:** Functions incorporate `require` checks to validate inputs and contract states, preventing erroneous or malicious actions.
   - **Example:** The `updateSwapTokensAtAmount` function ensures that the swap threshold does not exceed 1% of the total supply.

4. **Safe External Calls:**
   - **Address Library:** Utilizes the `sendValue` function from the `Address` library to safely transfer BNB, handling potential failures gracefully.
   - **Error Handling:** Ensures that failed transfers do not compromise the contract's state or functionality.

5. **Burn Functionality:**
   - **Purpose:** Allows the owner to burn tokens, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing token value.
   - **Security:** The burn function adjusts both `_tTotal` and `_rTotal` proportionally to maintain reflection accuracy and prevent inconsistencies.

6. **Rescue Functions:**
   - **Rescue BNB:** Enables the owner to retrieve stuck BNB from the contract.
   - **Rescue BEP20 Tokens:** Allows the owner to retrieve other BEP20 tokens mistakenly sent to the contract.
   - **Access Control:** These functions are restricted to the owner, ensuring that only authorized personnel can execute them.

**Best Practices:**

- **Regular Audits:** Engage professional auditors to conduct periodic security assessments.
- **Bug Bounties:** Implement bug bounty programs to incentivize the community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
- **Transparent Development:** Maintain open communication channels with the community regarding security updates and improvements.
