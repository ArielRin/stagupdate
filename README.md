### How Reflections Work in the `StagTokenV2` Contract

1. **Tokenomics and Fees:**
   - **Reflection Fee (RFI):** A portion of each transaction fee is designated as a reflection fee. This fee is used to reward token holders.
   - **Other Fees:** Additional fees may be taken for liquidity provisioning, NFT rewards, operations, and development.

2. **Reflection Distribution:**
   - **Reflection Fee Collection:** When a transaction occurs, the reflection fee is collected from the transaction amount.
   - **Reflection Distribution:** The collected reflection fee is used to increase the total supply of tokens, thereby giving all token holders a proportional increase in their token balance.

3. **Internal Accounting:**
   - **Reflection and Token Balances:** The contract maintains two types of balances:
     - **_rOwned:** The reflective balance, which includes the reflection fee distribution.
     - **_tOwned:** The token balance, which is only updated for excluded addresses (addresses that are not participating in reflections).

4. **Token Transfer Mechanism:**
   - **_transfer Function:** This function handles all token transfers and applies the necessary fees.
   - **Calculating Fees:** Fees are calculated based on the transaction amount and the current fee rates.
   - **Applying Fees:** Fees are deducted from the transaction amount and distributed according to the specified fee categories (RFI, liquidity, NFT rewards, etc.).
   - **Reflection Mechanism:** The reflection fee is used to increase the `_rTotal` supply, which effectively increases the balance of all token holders proportionally.

### Detailed Explanation with Code Snippets

#### Key Data Structures

- **_rOwned:** Mapping of addresses to their reflective balance.
- **_tOwned:** Mapping of addresses to their actual token balance (only used for excluded addresses).
- **_isExcluded:** Mapping of addresses to whether they are excluded from reflections.
- **_rTotal:** Total reflective supply.
- **_tTotal:** Total token supply.


### Summary of Reflections in `StagTokenV2`

- **Mechanism:** Reflections in `StagTokenV2` are achieved by reducing the `_rTotal` supply, which effectively increases the balance of all token holders proportionally.
- **Fees:** A portion of each transaction is designated as a reflection fee and is used to reduce `_rTotal`, thus distributing the fee back to all token holders.
- **Exclusions:** Certain addresses (e.g., the liquidity pool, dead wallet) can be excluded from reflections to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential issues.

By understanding these mechanisms, you can appreciate how the `StagTokenV2` rewards token holders through reflections, encouraging long-term holding and engagement with the token.
